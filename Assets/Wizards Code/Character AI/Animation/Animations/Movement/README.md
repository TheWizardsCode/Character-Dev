Most Animations in this folder are from the Unity Multipurpose Avatar project.

Note that these animations are incomplete. Many don't really do what they imply in their name :-(, for the most part. They are placeholders until we can get a full set of animations together that do what they are supposed to do.

Unity Multipurpose Avatar System, or UMA for short, is a free character creation and modification system with 
lots of cool features. UMA was designed with flexibility in mind, so although it's primary purpose is for working 
with humanoid characters, its systems can be adapted to work with any model you like. So if you want to create 
modifiable, optimised models for use in your games. UMA is the place to start. As a community project UMA is always
being improved. Although the best efforts are made to keep this wiki up to date, it relies on the spare time of helpful 
individuals to maintain. If you want more help or feel like chipping in then get involved with one of the community
