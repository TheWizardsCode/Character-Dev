  m_Description: "Sol\u2019s Grace represents the fulfillment of devotion\u2014a
    state in which the worshipper feels truly aligned with the divine will of the
    sun gods. Those who attain Sol\u2019s Grace are believed to receive warmth beyond
    the physical, wisdom beyond human understanding, and favor that ensures prosperity
    in their endeavors. It is a state of enlightenment, where the worshipper transcends
    mere ritual and is embraced by celestial radiance, guided by the ever-turning
    cycle of the heavens.\n\nIf Sol\u2019s Grace is not achieved, the consequences
    can be dire. Without this sacred harmony, doubt may fester in the heart, leading
    to spiritual uncertainty and misfortune. Crops may wither, the days may feel
    colder, and the worshipper may be cast into a shadow where the sun\u2019s light
    no longer nurtures. Some believe that those who fail to uphold Sol\u2019s Covenant
    risk being lost in an endless twilight, their souls wandering without direction,
    forever yearning for the dawn that will never come."
