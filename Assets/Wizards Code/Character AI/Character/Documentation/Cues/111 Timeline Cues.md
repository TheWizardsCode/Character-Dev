In this scene rather than triggering cues from a UI button we trigger them from a timeline. This allows sequences of cues to be played with a single in-game event. This is useful for cut scenes or scripted NPC events.

The scene is setup the same to the 101 scene with three marks for the actor to move to. However, rather than clicking a button controlled by a director class to send the cues to the actor there is a `Scene Timeline` object which contains a standard Unity timeline containing each of the three cues. When the scene starts this timeline will start playing and thus the actor will move to the first mark, wait for a short while, then move to the second mark.
