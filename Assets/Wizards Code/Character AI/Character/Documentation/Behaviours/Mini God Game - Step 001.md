This simple little game brings together many of the elements of the AI system for demonstration purposes.

This is a Mini-God Game, you are a God, but you have minimal powers. Though not a very powerful one. Your goal is to keep your people happy and alive. There's very little you can do to influence their lives. You can't tell them what to do, they have free will.

You can, however, change the world they live in.

You start out with 2 people in your population. Fortunately, they are capable of mating and creating more people, but they won't do that until they are happy. Your first job is to encourage them to build a house. To build a house they will need wood. So plant a few trees.

Simply point and click to place objects.

The two characters have different personalities and favour different kinds of work. They will chop trees down, build houses and more. But work takes up a lot of energy. When they are tired they will rest.

When they have collected enough wood they will build a house and will be able to go to sleep and rest properly.

They also need to eat. Plant some berry bushes and they will gather food to eat when hungry.

If their energy levels go too low they will start to loose health. If their health reaches 0 they will die.

If you click on a character you can see what they are doing, how long the task will take and what their current stats are. You can also adjust their current stats, this is for debug purposes and wouldn't normally be included in a game like this.
