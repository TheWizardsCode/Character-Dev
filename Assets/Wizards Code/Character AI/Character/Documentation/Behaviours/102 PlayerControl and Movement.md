The 102 scene shows basic movement using the `BaseActorController`. This uses simple translation and rotation to move the actor. No animation is possible.

Since this actor has no behaviours we will have to tell it how and where to move. This is achieved through a `ClickToMove` component on the `Dev UI Canvas`. 

Simply click on the ground plane and the character will turn towards and move to that location.
